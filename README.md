# POC-VR
VR demo of grabbing interactions to unlock and grab other object under 
constraint, such as bolt that prevent one object to be grabbed.
This project is made with Unity 2021.3.11f1, using OpenXR with the PicoXR SDK 
tested with Pico Neo 3 Link and Occulus Quest 2.
You can either test the application inside App folder or in the Unity 
Editor where you will need the VRIF asset from the Unity Asset Store
(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066)
Some original assets have been replaced due to licensing issue, it might have
broken some stuff such as collisions for example.
This project was made in autonomy during my internship at Gambi-M (https://www.gambi-m.com).
Thanks for letting me publicize this project.
